# Porcelain 
Shopping for skincare products can get tricky since every product's tagline sounds promising. That is why professionals suggest paying attention to the ingredients, as these ingredients are ultimately what determine the true quality of a product.
That is exactly what Porcelain focuses on - a quick and easy way for people to determine what the ingredients are saying about the quality of their product without having to research each ingredient individually. 
Porcelain is an application that identifies harmful ingredients in skincare products by analyzing their ingredient labels. A user simply uploads an image of the ingredient label, and Porcelain spits out a rating of 'Poor', 'Good' or 'Best' followed by a short description about the ingredient.
